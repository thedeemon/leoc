Bugs:
* optimizer removes copies a=b even if b changes in loop
* variable name clashing in functions(?)
* some functions not found after adding noise
* f(args.s) expands to f(args)

Todo:
* find and extract repeating expressions
* find loop invariants and move them out of loop
* modify VM: allow writing to source1 and source2
